                (“DHD”) specializes in creating master-planned communities that include world-class Hotel and Casino Resorts, residential neighborhoods, retail and restaurants, commercial, medical, solar parks, airports, golf courses, and entertainment complexes. Our respective development partners, operating management team and design associates are leaders in their respective fields.
              </h3>
              <p>DHD recently expanded its growth and are now a participating partner and majority/managing partner in two large-scale joint ventures, both U.S. and Internationally.  </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Riverbend Crossing</strong>
                (“Riverbend”) is a joint venture with Phillips Development and includes a 4,710-acre master planned resort community project in DeSoto County, Mississippi. Located along the Mississippi River and bordering the Gaming District in Tunica, Mississippi, the project is a mixed-use development including residential, commercial, entertainment and recreational elements, all surrounding a project-wide 600 acre man-made lake system. The project is highlighted by a <strong>Paramount Pictures, Inc.</strong>
                movie-based themed retail and entertainment center with branding, retail and intellectual properties. Once completed, Riverbend will contain the Paramount Entertainment Center, resort hotels, hotel/conference centers, shopping areas, golf courses, active adult villages and residential housing.
              </p>
              <p>The project site is accessed by two major interstate highways and is located within the Memphis, Tennessee Metropolitan Statistical Area (the “Memphis MSA”). The Memphis MSA is home to over 1.3 million people. Riverbend is structured to capitalize on the growth occurring in and around the area, and its elements are designed to attract residents and tourists alike. In addition, Riverbend will complement the adjacent gaming venues in Tunica, Mississippi, which receive over 11 million visitors annually, and will provide unique access to these attractions while still providing non-gaming entertainment options. This development will create over 50,000 jobs and is the largest master-planned community in the State of Mississippi.  </p>
              <p>
                <strong>SerenFusion Americas</strong>
                is a joint venture with Sun Fund Americas to design and develop master-planned resort communities in 13 South and Central American countries, including <strong>Costa Rica, Belize, Panama, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, Chile, Puerto Rico, Uruguay, Brazil, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and Cuba.</strong>
                The first phase of each community will include the development and installation of 500 - 1,000 acre solar parks with +50 MW utility scale photovoltaic (“PV”) power projects in strategic renewable energy locations. Our solar parks will improve the national and local communities through significant renewable energy infrastructure investments and by creating valuable local clean-tech jobs that will provide long-term local economic stability.

              <p>
                DHD’s communities include golf courses designed by <strong>Jack Nicklaus</strong>
                as well as his <strong>Signature Academies,</strong>

              <p>
                As the name implies, a <strong>Jack Nicklaus Signature Golf Course</strong>
                truly bears the signature of the world’s preeminent golf course designer. It has the thumbprint of arguably the greatest mind in golf history. It is the realization of one man’s vision, philosophy and passion for the greatest game of all. As Jack Nicklaus often says, what ends up on the top of a piece of ground is a piece of him. But, as the Golden Bear also adds, what goes beneath that piece of ground is a collaboration of a talented team that includes designers who work both in the field and in the design studio. It is a team of designers trained in landscape architecture, agronomy and the most state-of-the-art technology the industry has to offer. Nicklaus Design takes pride in the team it has assembled worldwide in offices that span both coasts of the United States, as well as Asia, Europe, Mexico and South Africa. Perhaps one of Jack’s greatest sources of pride is the group of Design Associates who make up the backbone of the world’s leading course design firm.

              </p>
              <p>Colin Hegarty, president of Golf Research Group studies the impact of golf course architects on property values and says that the best value-added brand is Jack Nicklaus. Since 2000, Nicklaus has designed 75 residential courses with an average net value of the overall project (golf and real estate) of $245.9 million. </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>"Architects value numbers are relevant when you're thinking of buying a home at one community versus another," says Hegarty. "Homes at Nicklaus communities are like blue chip stocks - their value grows dependably every year."  </p>
